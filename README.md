# freecodecamp-basic-algorithm-challenges
This is a repository for my solutions to freecode camp's Basic Javascript Algorithm and Data Structures Section

Every js file represents a solution to a challenge. You can visit https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/ to see the challenges on freecodecamp

I've tried to include as much information as possible to my solutions, without beint too verbose.
I've also written the code in a manner that is self explanatory
